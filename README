# Azure "Cloak Mode" Browser Extension

This is a browser extension for folks who might be streaming or presenting while simultaneously showing the azure portal. It does its very best to hide connection strings, email addresses, avatars, and anything that might show secure or personal information. It's not perfect, but it's 95 per cent solid. The goal is to avoid any kind of information leakage when presenting or streaming while live coding and using the azure portal.
